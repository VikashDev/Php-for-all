What is OOP?

OOP is a programming language model organized around " objects" rather than "actions" and "data" rather than "logic"

OOP Concepts

* Obejects
* Classes
* Methods & Properties
* Data Abstraction & Encapuation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Constructors/Destructors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Syntax

<?php
	Class User {

	public $someProperty;

	public function someFunction() {
		// Do Something
			}
		}
?>

Visibility

	public - Accessible outside of class
	protected - Accessable in class and any extended classes
	private - Accessible ONLY in owner class


Inheritance

	* Classes can be extended to a child class
	* Child clasess have access to all of it's parent properties and methods UNLESS the visibity of them is set to "private"

	Class ChildClass extends PraentClass{ 

	}


Instantiate & Use a class

	To create an instance ..
		
		user = new User;

	- Print a property

		<?php echo $user->firstName; ?>

	- Call a method/function

		<?php $usr->register(); ?>


Abstract Classes
	
	abstract class SomeClass {
		
		abstract public function someFunction() {

			}
	}

	* can't be instantiated and used directly
	* Must be extended by another class
	* If a property or method is "abstract" then the class also must be "abstract"
